</div>

<p>This is an accessible, CSS/JS based "popup tooltip" script that dynamically
converts regular footnotes in a document into tooltips that appear next to their
triggering elements.</p>


<script type="text/javascript">

// SuperNote setup: Declare a new SuperNote object and pass the name used to
// identify notes in the document, and a config variable hash if you want to
// override any default settings.

var supernote = new SuperNote('supernote', {});

// Available config options are:
//allowNesting: true/false    // Whether to allow triggers within triggers.
//cssProp: 'visibility'       // CSS property used to show/hide notes and values.
//cssVis: 'inherit'
//cssHid: 'hidden'
//IESelectBoxFix: true/false  // Enables the IFRAME select-box-covering fix.
//showDelay: 0                // Millisecond delays.
//hideDelay: 500
//animInSpeed: 0.1            // Animation speeds, from 0.0 to 1.0; 1.0 disables.
//animOutSpeed: 0.1

// You can pass several to your "new SuperNote()" command like so:
//{ name: value, name2: value2, name3: value3 }


// All the script from this point on is optional!

// Optional animation setup: passed element and 0.0-1.0 animation progress.
// You can have as many custom animations in a note object as you want.
function animFade(ref, counter)
{
 //counter = Math.min(counter, 0.9); // Uncomment to make notes translucent.
 var f = ref.filters, done = (counter == 1);
 if (f)
 {
  if (!done && ref.style.filter.indexOf("alpha") == -1)
   ref.style.filter += ' alpha(opacity=' + (counter * 100) + ')';
  else if (f.length && f.alpha) with (f.alpha)
  {
   if (done) enabled = false;
   else { opacity = (counter * 100); enabled=true }
  }
 }
 else ref.style.opacity = ref.style.MozOpacity = counter*0.999;
};
supernote.animations[supernote.animations.length] = animFade;



// Optional custom note "close" button handler extension used in this example.
// This picks up click on CLASS="note-close" elements within CLASS="snb-pinned"
// notes, and closes the note when they are clicked.
// It can be deleted if you're not using it.
addEvent(document, 'click', function(evt)
{
 var elm = evt.target || evt.srcElement, closeBtn, note;

 while (elm)
 {
  if ((/note-close/).test(elm.className)) closeBtn = elm;
  if ((/snb-pinned/).test(elm.className)) { note = elm; break }
  elm = elm.parentNode;
 }

 if (closeBtn && note)
 {
  var noteData = note.id.match(/([a-z_\-0-9]+)-note-([a-z_\-0-9]+)/i);
  for (var i = 0; i < SuperNote.instances.length; i++)
   if (SuperNote.instances[i].myName == noteData[1])
   {
    setTimeout('SuperNote.instances[' + i + '].setVis("' + noteData[2] +
     '", false, true)', 100);
	cancelEvent(evt);
   }
 }
});


// Extending the script: you can capture mouse events on note show and hide.
// To get a reference to a note, use 'this.notes[noteID]' within a function.
// It has properties like 'ref' (the note element), 'trigRef' (its trigger),
// 'click' (whether its shows on click or not), 'visible' and 'animating'.
addEvent(supernote, 'show', function(noteID)
{
 // Do cool stuff here!
});
addEvent(supernote, 'hide', function(noteID)
{
 // Do cool stuff here!
});


// If you want draggable notes, feel free to download the "DragResize" script
// from my website http://www.twinhelix.com -- it's a nice addition :).

**************************   USAGE INSTRUCTIONS   **************************

Notes are embedded in your document as normal HTML footnotes.

To show a note, the triggering element must have a CLASS attribute
of one of these forms:
  OBJECTNAME-hover-NOTENAME
  OBJECTNAME-click-NOTENAME
"hover" type notes will appear on mouseover of their trigger,
while "click" notes will appear when the trigger is clicked.

This trigger must match a note which has an ID attribute of this form:
  OBJECTNAME-note-NOTENAME

In both these cases OBJECTNAME is the name of your SuperNote object,
and NOTENAME is a unique name for a given note.

If you want, your note can also have a CLASS attribute containing either
or both a positional or behavioural "type" for your note, like so:
  CLASS="snp-POSITIONTYPE"
  CLASS="snb-BEHAVIOURTYPE"
  CLASS="snp-POSITIONTYPE snb-BEHAVIOURTYPE"

where the 'types' control how your note is hidden and positioned.
Default POSITION types are:
  * 'normal' does not adjust the note position via script at all.
  * 'mouseoffset' will offset the note from the mouse position when shown.
  * 'mousetrack' will make the note follow behind the mouse as it moves.
  * 'triggeroffset' will offset the note from its trigger when shown.
Default BEHAVIOUR types are:
  * 'pinned' will show normally, but not hide until manually closed.

You can define your own custom types in the core script; see its source for
more details and instructions.

In this example I have also used some "fallback" links with NAME="" and
HREF="#NAME" attributes on the links, so non-JS/CSS supporting browsers can
navigate to/from the notes easily.
You can remove these if you want as they are entirely optional.

<div style="background-color: #EEE; padding: 1em">

<p>Here's an example of a paragraph with a
<a href="#demo1" class="supernote-hover-demo1">SuperNote</a>.
SuperNotes are like regular footnotes turbocharged with JavaScript, so they
display as tooltips in modern browsers, and remain accessible elsewhere.</p>

<p>This next note is shows on click and is <a href="#demo3"
class="supernote-click-demo3">always pinned</a>.</p>

<p>You can also position relative to <a href="#demo4"
class="supernote-hover-demo4">triggering links</a>.</p>

<div style="position: relative">
 <p>Finally, here's a click note that's positioned <a href="#demoinline"
 class="supernote-click-demoinline">inline</a>.</p>
 <div id="supernote-note-demoinline" class="snp-normal notedefault" style="left: 30%; width: 400px;">
  <a name="demoinline"></a>
  This appears onclick, and remains visible until you click outside it.

<p>Open this document inside a text editor like Windows Notepad; instructions are within.
You don't need to edit the JS file itself, and you can leave the demo script unchanged.
You will want to open the .CSS file and change the note formatting there though,
and of course add your own notes to the BODY of the page ;).</p>

<p><em>Good luck - Angus.</em></p>
