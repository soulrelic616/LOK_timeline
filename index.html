<ul class="main-timeline">

   <li class="title timeline-1">Before Nosgoth's Recorded History</li>

    <li class="subtitle timeline-1">The Wheel of Fate</li>
    
    <li class="TL-1 timeline-1">The Land of Nosgoth – ruled by the two elder races, similar in power, but different in method and intention: the Vampires, and the Hylden.</li>
        
    <li class="TL-1 timeline-1">The Vampires worship the Wheel of Fate, the cleansing agony of birth, death, and rebirth, the purifying rhythm of the universe – the cycle which sustains all life, to which all souls are irresistibly drawn, manipulated by the parasitic Elder God.</li>
        
	<li class="subtitle timeline-1">The Vampire-Hylden War</li>
        
    <li class="TL-1 timeline-1">The Hylden oppose the Vampires’ tyrannous God, and refuse to submit to the Wheel of Fate. For this, the Vampires oppress their Hylden adversaries.</li>

	<li class="TL-1 timeline-1">The races battle for dominance of Nosgoth in a great, apocalyptic war, which flames for a thousand years, and will destroy both victor and vanquished alike.</li>
	
	
	<li class="subtitle timeline-1">The Genesis of the Pillars of Nosgoth</li>
        
    <li class="TL-1 timeline-1">In triumph, the Vampires banish the Hylden from the world with powerful magic, sealing them into another plane of existence, and raise the Pillars of Nosgoth as the lock that binds them.</li>

	<li class="TL-1 timeline-1">The nine Pillars reach high into the skies, and deep into the earth (representing Mind, Dimension, Conflict, Nature, Energy, Time, States, Death, and – at the center of all of them binding them together – Balance), intrinsically and supernaturally tied to the spiritual and physical "health" of the Land.</li>

	
	<li class="subtitle timeline-1">The Summoning of the Guardians</li>
        
    <li class="TL-1 timeline-1">With the appointment of the original Vampire Guardians, the Circle of Nine – a body of sorcerers entrusted with the safekeeping of the Pillars – is formed.</li>
    
    <li class="TL-1 timeline-1">When a member dies, the supernatural force behind the Pillars culls a worthy successor, who is destined from birth to fulfill that role.</li>
    
    <li class="TL-1 timeline-1">Each Guardian is aligned to the principle of the Pillar he serves, and the Balance Guardian is the axis of them all.</li>
    
    
    <li class="subtitle timeline-1">The Blood Curse</li>
	
	<li class="TL-1 timeline-1">In their defeat, the Hylden retaliate as they fall – afflicting the Vampires not only with a predatory blood-thirst, but with sterility as well</li>
    
    <li class="TL-1 timeline-1">With the Vampires’ transformation comes their enemies’ true revenge: immortality. Expelled from the cycle of death and rebirth, the apostates are cast from the Wheel of Fate.</li>
	
	<li class="TL-1 timeline-1">Plunged into despair, and unable to bear the separation from their God, many Vampires are driven to madness and self-annihilation.</li>


	<li class="subtitle timeline-1">The Forging of the Reaver</li>

	<li class="TL-1 timeline-1">The human Vorador is born</li>
    
    <li class="TL-1 timeline-1">The mystical sword known as the Soul Reaver is forged. Later to have more </li>
    
    
    <li class="subtitle timeline-1">The Dark Gift is Passed</li>
    
    <li class="TL-1 timeline-1"> Vorador is turned; he becomes a vampire</li>

	<li class="detail timeline1">Millennia pass – at least 2,000 years</li>

	<li class="title timeline-1">Nosgoth's early history</li>
    
   

	<li class="detail timeline1">Over 500 years before Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain</li>
    
    <li class="TL-1 timeline-1">Nosgoth's vampire population increases</li>
    
    <li class="TL-1 timeline-1">The formation of the Sarafan (a monastic order of warrior-priests, charged with the eradication of the vampires) by the Circle and the crusade to counter the "vampire menace." Malek commands the armies.</li>
    
	<li class="TL-1 timeline-1">The human Raziel is born, and becomes a Sarafan warrior-priest</li>

	<li class="TL-1 timeline-1">The Vampire Purges. Thousands of vampires killed</li>
    
    
    <li class="subtitle timeline-1">The Slaughter of the Circle</li>
    
    <li class="TL-1 timeline-1">The death of Janos Audron. He is murdered, his heart torn "throbbing and bleeding" from his body.</li>
    
    <li class="TL-1 timeline-1">Vorador takes his revenge upon the Circle for their sponsorship of the Sarafan crusade. He infiltrates their stronghold and murders six of the sorcerers, before humiliating the Sarafan general Malek (the Pillar of Conflict) in combat.</li>
    
    <li class="TL-1 timeline-1">The death of the Sarafan commanders. Raziel of the Sarafan dies in combat, and is entombed with the Sarafan martyrs</li>
    
    <li class="TL-1 timeline-1">The necromancer Mortanius (one of the surviving Circle members, and the Pillar of Death) punishes Malek for his failure to protect the Circle, by fusing his soul into a magical suit of armor.</li>
    
    <li class="TL-1 timeline-1">The Pillars cull new successors</li>

    <li class="TL-2 timeline-2">Kain establishes his empire by recruiting six lieutenants</li>
    
    <li class="TL-2 timeline-2">Raziel is raised first, and thus receives the greatest portion of Kain's gift. The six lieutenants have been too long dead to remember much of their human lives; they are ignorant of their Sarafan roots, or of Kain's blasphemous private joke.</li>
